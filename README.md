- 👋 Hi, I’m @luispicow
- 👀 I’m interested in learning anything related to software and data engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Scala language, functional programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to create own projects for learning purposes. And perhaps, collaborate on some data-related projects.
- 📫 You can reach me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luis-pico-795830147/).
- 😄 Pronouns: He
- ⚡ Fun fact: Even though I always get my hair cut by the same hairdresser, he never remembers me. Maybe it's because I only go once a year, jeje.
